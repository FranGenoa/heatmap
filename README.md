# PowerBI Visual Heatmap
The PowerBI Heatmap Visual enables users to draw a heatmap overlay from a X, Y coordinate set on to an existing image. The user specify the image, and provide a data set of X, Y coordinates and optionally an intensity for each data point. The radius and the bluriness of the heatmap bubbles can be customized as well as the max value for the intensity.
